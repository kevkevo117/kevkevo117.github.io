# üïµÔ∏è Digital Forensics Project: Windows System Compromise Investigation

## üß† Project Overview

This project presents a forensic analysis of a compromised Windows system. It replicates a scenario in which an internal workstation exhibited signs of unusual behavior and potential compromise. The investigation followed the forensic process of evidence preservation, analysis, interpretation, and reporting.

## üîß Tools Used

- **Autopsy**: Used for analyzing file system artifacts and building a timeline of user and system activity.
- **FTK Imager**: For creating and mounting forensic disk images.
- **Volatility Framework**: Memory dump analysis to detect signs of malware and anomalous behavior.
- **Wireshark**: Network packet analysis to identify suspicious or malicious traffic.

---

## üîç Key Findings

- **Suspicious EXE File**: A malicious executable was found in the Downloads folder, not whitelisted by the system.
- **Deleted Files Recovered**: Several deleted files were found containing suspicious PowerShell scripts.
- **Suspicious Registry Changes**: Evidence of startup persistence and unauthorized registry edits.
- **Network Traffic**: Wireshark logs indicated beaconing activity to an external IP, consistent with C2 behavior.

## üí° Recommendations

- Reimage affected systems and block known malicious IPs.
- Update antivirus definitions and perform a network-wide malware sweep.
- Apply user access controls and disable PowerShell for non-administrators.
- Regularly audit workstation logs and system startup entries.
